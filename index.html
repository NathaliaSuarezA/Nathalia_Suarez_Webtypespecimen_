        Lora is a freely accessible serif typeface distributed through Google
        Fonts. Its italic variants exhibit a distinctly calligraphic quality,
        which enhances their readability and aesthetic appeal on digital
        platforms. The typeface is available in four weights, each accompanied
        by corresponding italics.
